## Instructions

After creating your own github repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the exercises provided in `L11_functions_iteration.html`. A template is also provided (rename as `lastname_firstname_L11.qmd`).

You will only need to submit the rendered html file which **must contain a link to your github repo**. Including the github repo link provides all the support materials needed to reproduce your work, an essential feature of quality scientific work, especially data science/analysis work. See canvas for submission details.
